= AMD GPU Fan Control Tool for Mixed GPU Rigs =

This quick script adjusts the fan speed of all AMD GPUs found in a Linux based system to a fixed speed.  The speed is defined as a value from 0 to 255. 255 is 100%, 0 is 0%.  If no value is given, the default is around 88%.

This tool is a first pass at solving the problem of quickly controlling AMD GPU Fan speeds from the command line.  I borrowed from other tools, but rewrote it all from scratch to deal with parsing out other GPU types.
